Planning and Development life cycle of KUZEY

## Introduction 
- Documentation of KUZEY UMAY SAMLI’s planning lifecycle. Free to use but necessary to give reference to KUZEY UMAY SAMLI and asking him via platforms given bellow.
- Detailed planning lifecycle based on experiences about battle with ADHD, management frameworks and different type of lifecycles. Well planned and well organized for managing different aspects of the life in the same lifecycle.
- At the feature, this planning lifecycle will have mobile and computer app that is downloadable and priced (except people diagnosed with ADHD. For them it will be free.)
- Do not forget that these diagrams given at this document based on UML Activity diagram(s). Therefore, before reading the document, I highly recommend you to look the UML diagrams.
- Mainly there will be two parts. The Explanation part of the lifecycle and the Templates part. Lifecycle will explain how you will apply, maintain and change the plans you developed.
- Template part will be explaining how to systematically design planning templates for different time-lines and different topics. In addition, this part will show how to systemically store them.

## High Level explanation of the lifecycle 
- At figure 1, you will able to see the Activity diagram in a high level. Reason of calling activity diagram of life cycle at figure 1 ‘High level’ is, there are some parts we need to look deeper. They will be the lower levels. Events responsible for this leveling structure will have their own activity diagrams. Situation can create confusion but until now, you just need to know that there are some events in high-level activity diagram needs more explanation and will be explained at the feature sections.

- Figure 1

- At Figure 2, you will see the main reasons of why lifecycle at figure1 called ‘high level’. ‘Observation and Analysis’ and ‘Template improvements and feedbacks’ will have their own activity diagram. (In the red rectangle)
- These two special activities are seriously complicating the situation. In first look these two activates looking like creating confusion and problem. However, without continues observation and template improvements (especially the in the ADHD cases), the agility and usefulness of the planning templates will decrease significantly. Even worse, without good observation analysis and detection people tend to forget and not able to recall their previous experiences in a structure way. This planning lifecycles aim is to cover all aspects of the planning and living. Still you can adapt this lifecycle without these two activities. However, it will decrease the efficiency and it will most likely create a restructure and inefficient planning feedback and creation system.
- Highly recommended to at least try to use these two activities in the diagram. If it is not manageable, you can remove or modify the structure itself.

### High level Observation and Analysis Activity Explanation
- At figure 3, you can see the activity diagram of the observation and analysis activity itself. It looks complicated in the first look, but after reading the activities, it will be very clear to you what is what. As you realized, we still call observation and analysis part high level. In addition, you will understand why it is the case.
- Lower levels of observation and analysis part is not necessary for efficient system. So if you think even this is too much for me, feel free to skip directly to the ‘feedback activity explanation’ part.

- Figure 3

- At figure 4, you will able to see which parts will be having the lower levels inside the observation and analysis part. (In the red rectangle) Focus on ‘Observation about a specific culture or country’ and ‘observations about a specific person’ part(s). These parts will have special pyramid system we will talk at the feature. At this stage, you will start to systematically rank the people and countries in a structured way. Therefore, as you see, this is very specialized part for structure OSINT, Human and country intelligence with structured analysis of your position against them. If this part is the optional part. So feel free to skip this part if you do not think it is applicable for you.

- Figure 4

#### Observation and Analysis Activities Explanation
- At Figure 5 and Figure 6, you will able to see the UML activity diagrams of the country and person specific observation and analysis activity. They are same. However, because we need to divide them to not create confusion and problem.
- If you do not know what OSINT is, you can firstly look what it is exactly. It is highly recommended because without understanding OSINT, general structure will not be too meaningful.
- At the second activity starting from the end, we see something called ‘pyramid’.  We need to deep dive what is ‘pyramid’ .

- Figure 6

#### ‘Pyramid’ System
- As you can see, at the lifecycle we pyramid system. This is a system to identify what is our stance against an entity like a person or country. Every event related to the country or person will have a point addition to lessons identified. This will be helpful to create a structured way to systematize what we think about who and why

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/687788c4-ec28-4cc7-aa63-e2ae5d418623)
- Figure 7

- Every event will have a value between 100 to -100. If event is a good think for the specific entity, it will be positive number. Otherwise, it will be negative number. How you will give the points to events is completely up to you. Still, main recommendation is before entering the value of the event be sure that you are calm and relaxed.
- This is especially useful if you are too emotional about the events and people. It will be helpful to control and structure your mind about your position against entities.

### Template Feedback Activity Explanation
- You can see the activity diagram of the template feedback system at figure 8. 
- This system is especially useful when you are confused with planning and do not have a plan design structure. This part will give you continues DevOps system for you planning templates. 
- Mainly it will be useful to maintain your systems up-to-date and quickly and systematically behave when the environment and situation changes.

## Templates 
### Introduction 
- Template quality will generally determine the quality and capacity of the plan. They will boost you speed and increase the understandability even trying to use them after a while. Well-designed templates with different type of combinations will be necessary for you feature planning system. Different templates will boost your speed to create new plans quickly and gives you an ability to not lose the structure even at the most problematic times with high urgency.
### Template Naming
- Firstly, we need to name our templates in a systematic structure. This part can look silly, but it is the most important part when you are trying to find a template fast as possible. Systematic template naming means increased planning time. Templates have two main branch of features we need to define, ‘Attribute Based’ and ‘Time Based’.

- Attribute based features:
1-	R-> Template with distinct section for routines. 
2-	P-> Template with distinct section for tasks. 
3-	(RP)-> Template with combined section of routine and tasks.
4-	O-> Template with distinct section for observations.
5-	S-> Template with distinct section for sport.
6-	D-> Template with distinct section for Diet.
7-	(SD)-> Template with combined section of Sport and Diet.

- Time based features:
1-	W -> Weekly
2-	M -> Monthly
3-	Y -> Yearly
4-	N [number of days] -> independent plan. Needs to give the number of days this independent plan can cover.

- This naming and classification system can change according to your needs. However, do not forget that these classifications are the most important ones. Templates will always have their own unique rules. Because every template is specialized for a situation at the end. I recommend for naming and classification system change, when you need a differentiate to define the difference between two templates. Other than that, I do not recommend to increase the complexity of template classification.
- Now we can talk about how we will name the templates. At bellow, you can see the rule set of template naming. With the examples, you will understand how we will be naming the templates. I did not talk about the version part. Simply we are versioning all the versions of our templates to follow which version are we currently in. Goes from 1.0 to infinity and changes one per version.
'''
Rule: Template - (Attribute based features) - (Time based features) – (Version)
'''
'''
Ex1: Template - RPGSD – h – 1.0 
'''
- Meaning: This is a template has routines, non-routines, observations, Sports and diet section. In addition, it can cover just a week. In addition, it is at version 1.0. Means this is the first template created with these features.

- To follow the template usage at the plans, we will have a naming rule at the plans either. You can see the plan-naming rule with an example bellow.  
'''
Rule: (‘Exact dates plan covers’/’Template’) - (Attribute based features) - (Time based features) – (Version)
'''
'''
Ex2: 01.01.2020 – 06.01.2020 - RPGSD – h – 1.0
'''
- Meaning: This is a plan for between 01.01.2020 and 06.01.202 has routines, non-routines, observations, Sports and diet section. Plan can cover just a week. This template is the first version of templates with the features like this.

### Template Development 
- Template development is completely up to you. At the github page of this planning life cycle, you will able to see my own template(s). You can use them as an example. But I want to warn you about some points before starting to develop templates.
1- Always be realistic. Do not put more than you can handle inside the plan. If you do not think you will able to observe and take notes in real time, do not put it at the template you are actively using. Be efficient and realistic.
2- Always Use big punts to increase the readability. Small notes and symbols will always create a confusion for you when you look to your own plan. 
3- Always write a document of ‘Template handbook’. Never skip this part. Never think like: ‘I know how I should use’. Pencil always beats words when we are taking notes and structuring something. 
#### Template Hand Book
- Every template will have a different how to use based to the designed template. So always create a hand book of how to use that template. General topics of the hand book should:
1- How to follow routines and tasks 
2- Conditions for rearranging the plan inside the coverage date of the plan. 
3- Optimal conditions for this template 
4- Weaknesses and possible improvements of the template. 
So as you understand from the last part, this hand book will be updated with different version of the template.

## Conclusion  
- This is the end of KUZEY UMAY SAMLI’s planning lifecycle. Please let me know your comments and problems to improve this plan and lifecycle.
- Writer is not the native of English. Therefore, typos and mistakes are likely. Feel free to warn and give feedbacks.  
- This documentation will be at my GitHub page. I also will be providing example templates. And in 1 to 2 year, I will be releasing a planning app based on my planning framework. So Especially in this year it will be more then helpful to get feedback before the development stage starts. 

- Thanks for your time.
